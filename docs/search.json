    "text": "Motivation\nTraditional macroeconomic modelling often exclude financial markets, as the effects from the financial nominal variables on real variables are deemed insignificant per the classical dichotomy in macroeconomics. However, as earlier studies have shown and the descriptive analysis following this will illustrate, changes in the financial sector can spill over to economic activity. Therefore, it could help explaining the real economy, which could translate to improved forecasting performance.\nAs both monetary and fiscal policy is not only based on current economic conditions but also expectations regarding the future, it is essential to be able to generate accurate predictions of economic activity and inflation in the future."

Inflation seems to follow an upwards trend, while industrial production, financial stress and unemployment all seem to follow each other, such that industrial production is negative correlated with unemployment and financial stress. Intuitively it makes sense that economic activity decreases with increasing unemployment or stress and uncertainty in the financial sector.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Plots of time series"
